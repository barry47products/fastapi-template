"""
Domain rules package.

This package would contain domain rules and business logic validation.
Currently empty in this template - add your business rules here.

Examples of what might go here:
- Validation rules that span multiple domain entities
- Complex business rule engines
- Domain-specific calculation rules
- Business invariant checks

Note: Simple validation should stay within domain entities themselves.
Only complex rules that require coordination should be extracted here.
