## 2025-01-21 - External Configuration System Implementation

**Commit Message:**

```bash
feat: implement external configuration system with comprehensive TDD

- Create Settings Configuration module with zero hardcoded defaults
- All configuration must come from environment variables or .env files
- Add .env.test for testing with safe-to-commit test values
- Implement comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage using TDD
- Configure automatic coverage reporting (HTML, terminal, XML) with 100% enforcement
- Set up development tooling with consistent 88-char line length (Black, Ruff, Flake8)
- Add Poetry dependencies for FastAPI ecosystem and development tools
- Update project documentation with external configuration guidelines
- Exclude coverage files and test env files from git tracking

Settings module features:
- Pydantic validation with strict typing and immutability
- Environment enum validation for application environments
- Automatic .env.test loading during tests with .env fallback
- Fail-fast behaviour when required configuration is missing
- Full type safety with proper error handling

This establishes the foundation configuration system following the
principle of keeping all configuration external to code, completing
the first module in the flow-based TDD development approach.

## 2025-01-21 - Database Architecture Decision: PostgreSQL with Hierarchical Tags

**Commit Message:**

```bash
docs: adopt PostgreSQL database architecture with hierarchical tags support

- Replace Firestore with PostgreSQL across all technical documentation
- Add hierarchical tags field to provider data model for revenue generation
- Update architecture diagrams and deployment configurations for PostgreSQL
- Document JSONB-based tag structure for provider specialization and keyword bidding
- Update connection pooling from Firestore to AsyncPG for PostgreSQL
- Revise cost model from pay-per-operation to fixed instance pricing
- Update health checks, backup strategies, and GDPR compliance for PostgreSQL

Database architecture decision rationale:
- **Revenue model enablement**: Tags field critical for provider keyword bidding
- **Complex querying needs**: JSONB + pg_trgm for fuzzy phone matching and tag queries  
- **Provider deduplication**: PostgreSQL trigram similarity for phone number matching
- **Cross-group analytics**: SQL JOINs for "Davies has 47 endorsements across 12 groups"
- **Cost predictability**: Fixed PostgreSQL costs vs escalating Firestore per-operation fees
- **Local development**: Simpler Docker PostgreSQL vs complex Firestore emulator

Provider data model now includes:
- Basic fields: id, name, phone, category, endorsement_count, created_at  
- **Tags field**: `{"Electrician": ["Geysers", "Wiring"], "Emergency": ["24/7"]}`
- JSONB structure enables multi-level tag hierarchies for specialization
- Tag-based provider discovery and revenue optimization capabilities

This establishes the foundational database architecture supporting
both the core endorsement system and the revenue-generating tag-based
provider specialization features essential for business sustainability.

- `docs/research/neighbour-approved-deployment-modules.md` - Terraform Cloud SQL setup, application initialization
- `docs/research/neighbour-approved-starter.md` - AsyncPG dependency replacement

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL chosen over Firestore for complex querying needs
- **Tags Architecture**: JSONB column for hierarchical tag structure (`{"category": ["specialties"]}`)
- **Fuzzy Matching**: PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension for phone number similarity matching  
- **Provider Discovery**: JSONB containment queries for tag-based provider filtering
- **Revenue Model Support**: Tag-based keyword bidding and provider specialization capabilities
- **Cost Model**: Fixed PostgreSQL instance costs vs variable Firestore per-operation pricing
- **Development Experience**: Local PostgreSQL Docker setup vs complex Firestore emulator

**Architecture Impact:**

- **Provider Data Model**: Added hierarchical tags field for revenue generation
- **Query Capabilities**: Complex SQL queries for cross-group analytics and fuzzy matching
- **Revenue Features**: Foundation for tag-based provider bidding and specialization
- **Deployment Strategy**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with HA, backups, and point-in-time recovery

- Support field context for validation errors with proper error_code mapping
- Include comprehensive integration with structured logging and Prometheus metrics for observability
- Create behavioural test suite with 15 tests achieving 100% coverage focusing on HTTP responses and error handling behaviour
- Separate concerns by moving exception handling logic from main.py to dedicated infrastructure/api/exception_handlers.py module
- Follow TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle throughout development with proper FastAPI dependency injection testing
- Integrate with all existing domain-specific exceptions: PhoneNumberValidationError, ProviderValidationError, EndorsementValidationError, etc.
- Fix all pre-commit hook issues (Black, Ruff, MyPy) using proper type casting and exception handler signatures
- Resolve MyPy type errors using cast() for safe exception type casting without Any types
- Add proper HTTP status code mappings: 422 for validation, 404 for not found, 429 for rate limit, 500 for infrastructure

Exception handler features include:
- ValidationException handlers with field context and error_code preservation
- Business logic not found handlers (ProviderNotFoundException, EndorsementNotFoundException)
- Rate limit exception handlers with Retry-After headers and proper HTTP 429 responses
- Infrastructure exception handlers with production vs development message control
- Structured logging integration with client IP, error context, and request path tracking
- Prometheus metrics integration with error_code labeling and counter increments
- Timestamp inclusion in all error responses with ISO format
- Environment-aware error message detail (full messages in debug mode, generic in production)

This completes the Global Exception Handlers integration gap identified in the research documentation,
establishing comprehensive API-friendly error handling throughout the application with proper
observability and consistent error response format supporting client error handling and debugging.

**Key Changes:**

- `src/infrastructure/api/exception_handlers.py` - Comprehensive exception handlers with Pydantic response models (212 statements, 100% coverage)
- `tests/unit/test_main.py` - Added TestExceptionHandlers class with 15 behavioural tests covering HTTP response validation
- `src/main.py` - Integrated exception handler registration with app.add_exception_handler() for all domain exceptions
- `src/shared/exceptions.py` - All existing domain exceptions properly integrated with handler system
- Created dedicated TestExceptionHandlers class with behavioural testing approach instead of coverage-focused tests
- Moved exception handling logic from main.py to separate module reducing main application complexity

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Dedicated Module**: Exception handlers separated into infrastructure/api/exception_handlers.py for better organization
- **Strict Typing**: Full Pydantic response models (ErrorResponse, ValidationErrorResponse, RateLimitErrorResponse) without Any types
- **Behavioural Testing**: 15 tests focused on HTTP response behaviour, status codes, and error format validation
- **Domain Exception Integration**: All domain-specific exceptions (PhoneNumberValidationError, ProviderValidationError, etc.) properly handled
- **Observability Integration**: Structured logging and Prometheus metrics for all exception types with proper context
- **HTTP Standards Compliance**: Proper status codes (422, 404, 429, 500) with appropriate headers (Retry-After for rate limiting)
- **Environment-Aware Messages**: Debug mode shows detailed errors, production mode shows generic messages for security
- **Type Safety**: MyPy compliance using cast() for safe exception type conversion avoiding Any usage
- **Main App Integration**: Clean registration of all exception handlers with FastAPI application
