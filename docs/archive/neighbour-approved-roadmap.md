## 🔧 Architecture Refactoring Phase (NEXT PRIORITY)

### Current Architecture Concerns (Identified 2025-08-26)

**Status:** Not Started - Critical refactoring needed before continuing with new features

**Goal:** Address architectural complexity and coupling issues discovered during Message Processing Layer implementation to prevent future integration problems and technical debt accumulation.

### ✅ Phase 1: Configuration & Dependency Injection Refactoring (COMPLETED)

**Problem:** Multiple classes instantiate `Settings()` directly, creating 5+ separate instances that re-read environment variables

**✅ Solution Implemented:**

1. **✅ Settings Singleton Pattern**

   - ✅ Created singleton Settings instance with `_SettingsSingleton` class in `config/settings.py`
   - ✅ Implemented `get_settings()` function for dependency injection access
   - ✅ Eliminated all direct `Settings()` instantiations from NLP module constructors

2. **✅ Configuration Dependency Injection**

   ```python
   # Before (problematic):
   class SummaryGenerator:
       def __init__(self):
           self.settings = Settings().summary_generation

   # After (clean DI):
   class SummaryGenerator:
       def __init__(self, settings: SummaryGenerationSettings | None = None) -> None:
           if settings is None:
               from config.settings import get_settings
               app_settings: Settings = get_settings()
               settings = app_settings.summary_generation
           self.settings: SummaryGenerationSettings = settings
   ```

3. **✅ Infrastructure Integration**
   - ✅ Updated `app_factory.py` and exception handlers to use singleton pattern
   - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with optional settings parameters
   - ✅ Fixed all test compatibility issues with proper mock patterns

**✅ Implementation Results:**

- ✅ Eliminated 5+ duplicate Settings instantiations across NLP modules
- ✅ Reduced environment variable re-reading overhead
- ✅ Improved testability with dependency injection patterns
- ✅ 99.93% test coverage achieved (810 tests passing)
- ✅ All quality checks passing (ruff, mypy, black, isort)
- ✅ Zero breaking changes with full backward compatibility
- ✅ Fixed missing test coverage paths in MentionExtractor and SummaryGenerator

### ✅ Phase 2: Domain/Infrastructure Separation (COMPLETED)

**Problem:** Domain models directly import infrastructure (metrics, logging), violating clean architecture

**✅ Solution Implemented:**

1. **✅ Domain Events Pattern**

   - ✅ Created comprehensive domain event system with `DomainEvent` base class and `DomainEventPublisher` interface
   - ✅ Implemented `DomainEventRegistry` for dependency-free event publishing from domain models
   - ✅ Created specific domain events: `PhoneNumberValidated`, `ProviderEndorsementIncremented`, `EndorsementStatusChanged`, etc.
   - ✅ Infrastructure subscribes to events via `ObservabilityEventPublisher` for metrics/logging
   - ✅ Complete separation: domain models publish events, infrastructure handles cross-cutting concerns

2. **✅ Clean Architecture Compliance**

   - ✅ Domain models (Provider, Endorsement, PhoneNumber) publish domain events instead of direct infrastructure calls
   - ✅ Infrastructure layer handles all logging, metrics, and cross-cutting concerns via event subscriptions
   - ✅ Domain remains pure business logic with no infrastructure dependencies
   - ✅ `ObservabilityEventPublisher` coordinates between domain events and infrastructure services

3. **✅ Implementation Results:**
   - ✅ All domain models now use `DomainEventRegistry.publish(event)` instead of direct metrics/logging calls
   - ✅ Complete clean architecture separation achieved across all 3 domain modules
   - ✅ Infrastructure integration maintained through event-driven architecture patterns
   - ✅ 100% test coverage for domain events base classes, registry, and publisher integration
   - ✅ All quality checks passing with proper MyPy suppressions for Pydantic patterns

### ✅ Phase 3: Import Structure Simplification (COMPLETED)

**Problem:** Mixed import patterns and circular dependency risks with domain re-exports

**✅ Solution Implemented:**

1. **✅ Remove Domain Re-exports**

   - ✅ Removed all re-exports from `src/domain/__init__.py` (kept only submodule imports)
   - ✅ Eliminated circular dependency risks at root domain level
   - ✅ Forced explicit imports preventing ambiguous import sources

2. **✅ Establish Import Rules:**

   - ✅ Value objects: `from src.domain.value_objects import PhoneNumber, GroupID`
   - ✅ Models: `from src.domain.models import Provider, Endorsement`
   - ✅ Rules: `from src.domain.rules import ProviderMatcher, ProviderMatchResult`
   - ✅ Events: `from src.domain.events import DomainEventRegistry`

3. **✅ Update All Existing Imports**
   - ✅ Updated 8 files to use explicit import patterns
   - ✅ Removed all `from src.domain import X` patterns from codebase
   - ✅ Ensured consistency across entire codebase with isort integration

**✅ Implementation Results:**

- ✅ All quality checks passing: ruff, mypy, black, isort
- ✅ Zero circular dependency risks with explicit import paths
- ✅ Enhanced import clarity - immediately clear where each item is defined

### ✅ Phase 4: Infrastructure Pattern Improvements - **COMPLETED**

**Problem:** Singleton anti-pattern with `_MetricsCollectorSingleton` and `_HealthCheckerSingleton`

   - ✅ Created comprehensive test fixtures for service registry
   - ✅ Added clean_service_registry fixture for proper test isolation
   - ✅ Enhanced mock configurations with proper type annotations
   - ✅ Test state isolation between singleton and service registry patterns

## 📝 Golden Rules

1. **WIP = 1** - Complete ONE item entirely before starting next
2. **Test First** - Always write failing tests before implementation
3. **100% Coverage** - No exceptions, both line and branch coverage
4. **Infrastructure Integration** - Every module must integrate with foundation
5. **External Configuration** - All settings via environment variables
6. **Quality Gates** - All linting, type checking, security checks must pass
7. **Commit per Item** - One complete item = one commit with proper message

**Remember:** Follow the sequential pipeline. Complete Foundation Integration Review before moving to Message Processing Layer.
