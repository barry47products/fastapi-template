# Architectural Principles: Domain-Infrastructure Decoupling

## Core Principle: Decouple Your Domain from Infrastructure

### 🚫 Anti-Pattern: Domain-Infrastructure Coupling

When your domain depends directly on databases, ORMs, payment providers, logging systems, or metrics collectors, every infrastructure change ripples into your business logic. This creates several critical problems:

- **Fragile Architecture**: Upgrading a library, switching a vendor, or changing storage breaks your core domain
- **Testing Complexity**: Unit testing business logic requires setting up databases, external services, and infrastructure
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Business rules become tightly bound to specific technical implementations
- **Reduced Agility**: Infrastructure decisions constrain business logic evolution
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Business logic becomes polluted with technical concerns

**Example of Problematic Coupling:**

```python
class Provider:
    def endorse(self, endorser_id: str) -> None:
        self.endorsement_count += 1
        # ❌ Direct infrastructure coupling
        metrics_collector.increment_counter("provider_endorsements")
        logger.info(f"Provider {self.id} endorsed by {endorser_id}")
        database.save(self)  # ❌ Direct database dependency
```

### ✅ Recommended Pattern: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

By introducing interfaces (ports & adapters), your domain stays pure and focused on business rules. Infrastructure becomes just a replaceable detail - swap a database, payment provider, or ORM without touching domain code.

**Benefits of Decoupling:**

- **Pure Business Logic**: Domain models focus exclusively on business rules
- **Infrastructure Flexibility**: Replace databases, logging, metrics, or external services without domain changes
- **Superior Testability**: Test business logic in isolation without infrastructure setup
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Infrastructure evolution doesn't break business logic
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit separation between business concerns and technical implementation

## ✅ Our Completed Implementation: Architecture Refactoring Success

### Our Domain Events Implementation

#### Pure Domain Logic with Event Publishing

```python
# ✅ Clean domain model - zero infrastructure dependencies
class Provider:
    def endorse(self, endorser_id: str) -> None:
        self.endorsement_count += 1
        # ✅ Publish domain event instead of direct infrastructure calls
        DomainEventRegistry.publish(
            ProviderEndorsementIncremented(
                provider_id=self.id,
                endorser_id=endorser_id,
                new_count=self.endorsement_count
            )
        )
```

#### Infrastructure Event Handling

```python
# ✅ Infrastructure subscribes to domain events
class ObservabilityEventPublisher:
    def handle_provider_endorsement_incremented(
        self, event: ProviderEndorsementIncremented
    ) -> None:
        # Infrastructure handles cross-cutting concerns
        self.metrics_collector.increment_counter("provider_endorsements")
        self.logger.info(
            "Provider endorsement incremented",
            provider_id=event.provider_id,
            endorser_id=event.endorser_id
        )
```

## 🚧 Next Phase: Applying Principles to New Development

### Current Priority: Persistence Layer Implementation

Now that our architecture foundation is complete, we're applying these same principles to build the **Persistence Layer**:

#### Repository Pattern Implementation (Next Sprint)

```python
# ✅ Domain interface (port) - to be implemented
class ProviderRepository(Protocol):
    def save(self, provider: Provider) -> None: ...
    def find_by_id(self, provider_id: ProviderId) -> Provider | None: ...

# ✅ Infrastructure implementation (adapter) - to be implemented
class FirestoreProviderRepository:
    def save(self, provider: Provider) -> None:
        # Firestore-specific implementation
        # Domain events still handle cross-cutting concerns
        provider.mark_as_persisted()  # Triggers domain event
```

#### Persistence Layer Design (Following Our Principles)

- **Domain**: Define repository interfaces and business rules
- **Infrastructure**: Implement Firestore adapters, handle connection management
- **Events**: Domain events for persistence operations (`ProviderPersisted`, `EndorsementStored`, etc.)
- **No Direct Coupling**: Domain never imports Firestore or database concerns

### Future Phase: WhatsApp Integration Layer

After persistence, we'll apply the same principles to **WhatsApp Integration**:

#### Message Processing with Clean Architecture

```python
# ✅ Domain interface (port) - planned implementation
class MessageSender(Protocol):
    def send_message(self, message: str, recipient: GroupId) -> None: ...

# ✅ Infrastructure implementation (adapter) - planned implementation
class GreenAPIMessageSender:
    def send_message(self, message: str, recipient: GroupId) -> None:
        # GREEN-API specific implementation
        # Domain events handle audit, metrics, etc.
```

#### WhatsApp Integration Components (Planned)

1. **GREEN-API Client** - External API adapter following ports & adapters
2. **Message Processor** - Application service using domain events for cross-cutting concerns
3. **Response Generator** - Domain logic with infrastructure-independent message creation

### Implementation Strategy for New Development

**Our Proven Pattern (Applied to All New Development):**

1. **Domain First**: Define business rules and domain interfaces
2. **Events Architecture**: Use domain events for all cross-cutting concerns
3. **Infrastructure Last**: Implement adapters that satisfy domain interfaces

**Quality Gates (Established Standards):**

- Domain layer has **zero infrastructure imports**
- All cross-cutting concerns handled via **domain events**
- **100% test coverage** without infrastructure dependencies
- Integration tests cover infrastructure adapters separately
