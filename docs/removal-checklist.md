## Key Decisions Made

### ✅ **Preserve Technical Accuracy**

- **Firestore references kept** where they refer to actual supported technology
- **Implementation documents unchanged** (DOCKER.md, architecture-improvement-plan.md)
- **Infrastructure details preserved** for accuracy

### ✅ **Genericize Business Logic**

- **Domain examples transformed**: Provider/endorsement → User/interaction
- **External service examples**: WhatsApp/GREEN-API → Generic APIs
- **Business concepts**: Endorsement capture → Data processing

### ✅ **Remove Project-Specific Content**

- **External business documents**: ChatterBridge files completely removed
- **Project-specific badges**: SonarCloud URLs removed
- **Business branding**: WhatsApp branding → Generic messaging

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All business logic references systematically removed while preserving technical accuracy and implementation details.
