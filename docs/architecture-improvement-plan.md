# Architecture Improvement Plan

**Created**: 9 September 2025  
**Objective**: Transform the FastAPI template from an architecture showcase into a production-ready, pragmatic starting point for teams.

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the architectural evaluation findings, focusing on simplification, pragmatism, and production readiness. The improvements are organised into four phases, each building upon the previous to ensure a smooth transition without breaking existing functionality.

## Principles

1. **Workflow**: Follow a TDD approach with Failing test first (Red) -> Implementation (Green) -> Refactor (Refactor)

2. **Quality Gates**: Every change must pass:
   - 100% test coverage (line + branch) - no exceptions
   - Full type annotations with mypy strict mode
   - Ruff formatting and linting (all rules must pass)
   - No `Any` types unless absolutely required

3. **Code Standards**:
   - Self-documenting code - no comments
   - Immutable models with Pydantic `frozen=True`
   - Specific exceptions - never generic `Exception`
   - Pure functions where possible
   - British English in all output

4. **Testing Focus**:
   - Domain-focused test classes (not coverage-focused)
   - Behaviour-driven test names that tell the story
   - Test placement mirrors src structure
   - Mock external dependencies only

5. **Infrastructure Integration**:
   - Every module must integrate with observability foundation
   - Use structured logging with context
   - Increment metrics for business operations
   - Raise domain-specific exceptions with error codes

6. **Import Discipline**:
   - Module-level imports only (✅ `from src.domain.models import Provider`)
   - No direct imports from sub-modules (❌ `from src.domain.models.provider import Provider`)

7. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Zero hardcoded values
   - All configuration via environment variables
   - Use Pydantic Settings for validation

8. **Flow-Based Development**:
   - WIP = 1 (complete one improvement entirely before starting next)
   - Each phase must be 100% complete and tested
   - Update documentation as you go

9. **Git Standards**:
   - Commits focus on WHY (business context), not WHAT (diff shows that)
   - One-line summary under 72 characters
   - Avoid implementation details in commit messages

## Phase 1: Simplification & Pattern Reduction (Week 1)

### 1.1 Replace Service Registry with FastAPI Dependency Injection ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: 160+ lines of boilerplate for managing 8 services  
**Solution**: Use FastAPI's native dependency injection system

**Implementation Steps**:

```python
# Instead of ServiceRegistry pattern:
# OLD: registry.get_metrics_collector()
# NEW: FastAPI dependencies

# src/infrastructure/dependencies.py
from functools import lru_cache
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import Depends

@lru_cache
def get_metrics_collector() -> MetricsCollector:
    """Singleton metrics collector via FastAPI DI."""
    return MetricsCollector()

@lru_cache
def get_health_checker() -> HealthChecker:
    """Singleton health checker via FastAPI DI."""
    return HealthChecker(timeout=30)

# Usage in routes:
async def endpoint(
    metrics: Annotated[MetricsCollector, Depends(get_metrics_collector)]
):
    metrics.increment_counter("endpoint_calls")
```

**Tasks**: ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**

1. ✅ Create `src/infrastructure/dependencies.py` with all service providers
2. ✅ Remove `ServiceRegistry` class entirely
3. ✅ Update all service access to use `Depends()` pattern
4. ✅ Remove dual singleton/registry pattern from health checker
5. ✅ Update tests to use dependency overrides

**Completed Work**:

- **ServiceRegistry Removal**: Completely removed 160+ lines of service registry boilerplate
- **Dependencies Module**: Created `src/infrastructure/dependencies.py` with @lru_cache pattern for singleton services
- **Implementation Updates**: Updated all infrastructure components (metrics, health checker, feature flags, repository factory, webhook verifier) to use direct function calls instead of service registry
- **Test Migration**: Fixed 28 failing tests that referenced the removed service registry, simplifying complex mocking to focus on actual behaviour
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved slow test performance by 95% (from 3.3s to 0.2s) by reducing time intervals in rate limiter and health checker tests
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained singleton patterns during transition to ensure no breaking changes to existing APIs

**Impact**: Reduced complexity from 160+ lines of service registry infrastructure to simple, maintainable dependency injection functions. All tests pass with 100% coverage maintained.

**Commit Message**:

```bash
feat: replace service registry with FastAPI dependency injection

Eliminates service registry anti-pattern with 160+ lines of boilerplate in favour of FastAPI's native dependency injection using @lru_cache.

Simplifies infrastructure management while maintaining singleton behaviour and backward compatibility. All components now use direct function calls instead of registry lookups, improving code clarity and maintainability.

### 1.2 Simplify Repository Factory ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: Tightly coupled to specific repository types  
**Solution**: Generic repository provider with type registration

**Implementation**:

```python
# src/infrastructure/persistence/repository_provider.py
from typing import Protocol, Type, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T', bound=Repository)

class RepositoryProvider:
    """Simple, extensible repository provider."""

    def __init__(self, database_url: str, db_type: DatabaseType):
        self.database_url = database_url
        self.db_type = db_type
        self._repositories: dict[Type, Repository] = {}

    def get[T](self, repository_type: Type[T]) -> T:
        """Get or create repository instance."""
        if repository_type not in self._repositories:
            self._repositories[repository_type] = self._create_repository(repository_type)
        return self._repositories[repository_type]

    def _create_repository(self, repo_type: Type[Repository]) -> Repository:
        """Factory method for creating repositories based on db_type."""
        # Implementation based on feature flags
```

**Completed Work**:

- **Generic Provider Implementation**: Created `RepositoryProvider` class with type-safe generic registration using `TypeVar` and `Protocol`
- **Type Safety**: Implemented proper type annotations with `cast()` function for MyPy compliance
- **Environment Configuration**: Added environment-based configuration with `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_TYPE` environment variables
- **FastAPI Integration**: Updated `src/infrastructure/dependencies.py` to use repository provider instead of factory pattern
- **Singleton Pattern**: Maintained backward compatibility with singleton repository access functions
- **Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite with 11 tests covering provider configuration, dependency injection, and environment setup
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Updated all imports and references from repository factory to repository provider

**Impact**: Eliminated tight coupling between repository factory and specific repository types. The new generic provider supports type registration and can easily accommodate new repository implementations without code changes. All 648 tests pass with full type safety maintained.

**Commit Message**:

```bash
feat: simplify repository factory with generic provider pattern

Replaces tightly-coupled repository factory with generic RepositoryProvider that uses type registration and supports multiple database backends.

Eliminates hardcoded repository types in favour of TypeVar-based generic registration, enabling easy extension without code changes. Maintains singleton behaviour and backward compatibility while adding environment-based configuration.

### 1.3 Reduce Pattern Complexity ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: Excessive pattern complexity with factory classes, ABC inheritance, and hardcoded event handlers  
**Solution**: Simplify to essential patterns using Protocols, generic handlers, and remove obsolete factories

**Actions**:

1. Remove unnecessary factory patterns where simple functions suffice
2. Consolidate event handling into a single subscriber pattern
3. Replace abstract base classes with Protocols where appropriate
4. Remove `ObservabilityEventPublisher` complexity - use simple event handlers

**Completed Work**:

- **Repository Factory Removal**: Completely removed obsolete `RepositoryFactory` and `SampleRepositoryFactory` classes along with their tests, as they were superseded by the generic `RepositoryProvider`
- **ABC to Protocol Migration**: Converted `DomainEventPublisher` from Abstract Base Class to `@runtime_checkable` Protocol, eliminating inheritance requirements and enabling structural typing
- **Event Publisher Simplification**: Drastically reduced `ObservabilityEventPublisher` from 150+ lines of hardcoded event-specific handlers to 25 lines of generic event handling that works with all domain events
- **Test Simplification**: Replaced complex 23-method test suite testing specific event types with 6 focused tests validating generic behaviour patterns
- **Pattern Elimination**: Removed approximately 200+ lines of unnecessary factory and handler boilerplate code

**Impact**: Achieved significant architectural simplification while maintaining all functionality. Generic event handlers eliminate the need to add new handlers for each event type. Protocol-based interfaces support duck typing without inheritance constraints. The codebase now follows pragmatic simplification principles with cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Commit Message**:

```bash
feat: reduce pattern complexity with generic handlers and protocols

Simplifies architecture by removing unnecessary factory patterns, converting ABC to Protocol, and replacing hardcoded event handlers with generic implementation.

Eliminates 200+ lines of boilerplate code while maintaining functionality. Event publisher now uses generic structured logging that captures all event data automatically, and domain interfaces use modern Python typing conventions.

## Phase 2: Testing Improvements (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Fix Test Theatre (Mock Testing) ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem**: Tests that test the mocks rather than behaviour  
**Solution**: Focus on integration tests with real implementations and add comprehensive test categorisation

**Implementation**:

```python
# Mark test categories for different audiences
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.fast
@pytest.mark.behaviour
class TestUserBusinessRules:
    """Domain logic tests - for developers."""

@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.integration
class TestPersistenceLayer:
    """Infrastructure tests - for DevOps/SRE."""

@pytest.mark.e2e
@pytest.mark.api
class TestAPIEndpoints:
    """End-to-end tests - for QA/Full-stack engineers."""
```

**Tasks**: ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**

1. ✅ Audit all tests for mock-testing-mock scenarios
2. ✅ Replace mock-heavy tests with behaviour-focused tests
3. ✅ Add pytest markers for categorisation:
   - `@pytest.mark.unit` - Pure logic tests
   - `@pytest.mark.integration` - Component interaction tests
   - `@pytest.mark.fast` - Fast-running tests
   - `@pytest.mark.behaviour` - Behaviour-driven tests
   - `@pytest.mark.security` - Security validation
   - `@pytest.mark.smoke` - Smoke tests
4. ✅ Update test running commands in Makefile with marker-based commands

**Completed Work**:

- **Mock Anti-Pattern Elimination**: Identified and fixed mock-testing-mock scenarios in observability tests, replacing them with actual behaviour verification
- **Test Categorisation**: Added comprehensive pytest markers to key test files including domain health tests, infrastructure observability tests, and metrics tests  
- **Makefile Enhancement**: Added new test commands supporting marker-based test execution:
  - `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only
  - `make test-integration` - Run integration tests only
  - `make test-behaviour` - Run behaviour-driven tests
  - `make test-security` - Run security tests
  - `make test-smoke` - Run smoke tests
  - `make test-fast` - Run fast tests (excludes slow markers)
- **Behaviour Testing**: Converted 7 mock-heavy logger tests to actual behaviour tests that verify logging functionality without mocking the methods being tested
- **Test Strategy**: Established clear distinction between legitimate external dependency mocking and mock anti-patterns

**Impact**: Eliminated test theatre scenarios while maintaining comprehensive test coverage. Test suite now properly verifies actual component behaviour rather than mock call patterns. New marker system enables targeted test execution for different development scenarios and CI/CD pipelines.

**Commit Message**:

```bash
feat: fix test theatre with behaviour-focused tests and markers

Eliminates mock-testing-mock anti-patterns by replacing mock call verification with actual behaviour testing. Adds comprehensive pytest marker system for targeted test execution.
