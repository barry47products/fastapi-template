# Documentation Polish Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses Section 5.2 of the Architecture Improvement Plan, focusing on transforming project-specific documentation into a truly generic FastAPI template that can be used by any developer.

## Current Issues Identified

### Project-Specific References Found

- **CLAUDE.md**: Contains WhatsApp/GREEN-API integration, Firestore specifics, "provider", "endorsement" business logic
- **README.md**: References SonarCloud project badges with specific project ID `barry47products_fastapi-template`
- **External docs**: `/docs/external/` contains 3 ChatterBridge-specific documents that are business logic focused
- **Code examples**: Contains domain-specific examples like "provider", "endorsement capture pipeline"

### Missing Documentation

- No getting started tutorial or video guide
- Lack of visual architecture diagrams
- No FAQ section for common questions
- Examples are too specific to be broadly applicable

## Planned Tasks

### 1. Remove Project-Specific Business Logic References

#### CLAUDE.md Updates

- Replace WhatsApp/GREEN-API examples with generic API integrations (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid, AWS)
- Transform Firestore-specific examples to generic database patterns
- Change "provider/endorsement" business logic to "user/order/product" patterns
- Update git commit examples to use generic feature descriptions

#### README.md Cleanup

- Remove SonarCloud badges with hardcoded project IDs
- Replace with placeholder badges or generic quality indicators
- Update clone URL to use template placeholder
- Genericise API examples and use cases

#### External Documentation Cleanup

- Remove `/docs/external/chatterbridge-*` files (business-specific)
- Archive any valuable architectural patterns for potential reuse
- Clean up any remaining business logic references in other docs

### 2. Genericise Examples to be Broadly Applicable

#### Domain Models

- Replace "Provider" with "User" or "Customer"
- Replace "Endorsement" with "Order" or "Review"
- Use common e-commerce/SaaS patterns (Product, Category, Payment)
- Ensure examples represent 80% of typical API use cases

#### API Routes

- Transform sample routes to generic CRUD operations
- Add common patterns: authentication, pagination, filtering
- Include typical business scenarios: user registration, data export, file upload
- Provide examples that developers can immediately relate to

#### Configuration Examples

- Use generic service names instead of specific integrations
- Provide multiple database examples (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite)
- Include common external service patterns (email, storage, payment)
- Show environment configuration for different deployment scenarios

#### Test Examples

- Replace domain-specific test cases with universal scenarios
- Cover common testing patterns: validation, authentication, business rules
- Include integration test examples for typical API workflows
- Demonstrate behavior-driven testing with generic user stories

### 3. Create Getting Started Guide

#### New Documentation File: `docs/getting-started.md`

- **Quick Setup**: 5-minute API creation walkthrough
- **Your First Endpoint**: Step-by-step guide to adding new functionality
- **Testing Your API**: How to write and run tests effectively
- **Deployment Basics**: Simple deployment to common platforms

#### Video Tutorial Outline

- **Duration**: 10-15 minutes
- **Content**: Screen recording showing complete setup process
- **Sections**:
  1. Template setup and configuration (3 min)
  2. Creating first endpoint (4 min)
  3. Adding tests and validation (3 min)
  4. Running quality checks (2 min)
  5. Docker deployment (3 min)

#### Interactive Examples

- Copy-paste code snippets with explanations
- Complete working examples that users can run immediately
- Progressive complexity: simple → intermediate → advanced
- Links to relevant documentation sections for deeper learning

### 4. Add Architecture Diagrams

#### System Overview Diagram

```mermaid

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Content Audit and Cleanup (2-3 hours)

1. **Audit all documentation** for business-specific references
2. **Create removal checklist** with specific files and line numbers
3. **Backup existing content** that might be valuable for future reference
4. **Remove or archive** business-specific external documentation

### Phase 2: Content Transformation (4-5 hours)

1. **Replace domain examples** systematically across all files
2. **Update configuration examples** to use generic patterns
3. **Transform code examples** to common use cases
4. **Update README** with generic project setup instructions

### Phase 3: New Content Creation (6-8 hours)

1. **Write getting started guide** with progressive difficulty
2. **Create architecture diagrams** using Mermaid syntax
3. **Develop FAQ content** based on common developer questions
4. **Prepare video tutorial script** for future recording

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (2-3 hours)

1. **Test template setup** from scratch using new documentation
2. **Validate all examples** work as documented
3. **Review for consistency** across all documentation files
4. **Get feedback** from fresh perspective (if possible)
