# Neighbour Approved - Onboarding Strategy & User Journey

## Executive Summary

Neighbour Approved is an **active assistant** for WhatsApp groups that helps members find trusted local service providers through community endorsements. When someone requests a provider, the bot immediately responds with pre-vetted options from the group's endorsement history. Members simply react with an emoji to receive private contact details.

**Key Value Proposition**: "Get instant recommendations for trusted providers your neighbours have actually used - just tap ‚ö° for their details."
