### 6. Live Testing and Production Validation

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Description**: Real-world testing with ngrok tunnel integration and full persistence validation
- **Implementation**:
  - Ngrok tunnel setup and webhook authentication validated
  - Contact card processing creates real Firestore records (providers + endorsements)
  - Enhanced fuzzy matching tested with real-world message patterns
  - Performance monitoring: ~570ms for contact cards, ~27ms for text messages
  - Fixed critical persistence bug in contact message processing
  - Added structured mention processing to bypass text extraction limitations
  - Full end-to-end pipeline validation from WhatsApp ‚Üí MessageProcessor ‚Üí Firestore
  - Consistent structured logging formatting resolved across application startup

### 7. Context Attribution System

- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-01-02)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Correlate contact card shares with the service requests that prompted them
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhanced webhook schema with quoted/reply message support (`ExtendedTextMessageContent`)
  - Enhanced Endorsement model with attribution fields (`request_message_id`, `response_delay_seconds`, `attribution_confidence`)
  - ContextAttributionService with multi-mode analysis:
    - Direct quoted message detection (95% confidence)
    - Temporal proximity analysis (variable confidence based on timing)
    - Sender behaviour pattern recognition (community vs self-responses)
  - Temporal patterns: Immediate (0-30s), Near-term (30s-15min), Distant (15min-1hr)
  - 24 new tests (14 service + 10 domain) with 100% coverage
  - Full MyPy compliance and linting standards
- **Impact**: Transforms generic contact shares into contextualised recommendations
