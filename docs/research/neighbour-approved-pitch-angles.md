# Neighbour Approved: Strategic Pitch Angles

## Pitch Angle 1: "The Trust Revolution"

### _For community members and WhatsApp group administrators_

### The Hook

"Stop scrolling through endless 'anyone know a good plumber?' messages. Your neighbours already know who's brilliant—and now that knowledge is organised, permanent, and instantly accessible."

### The Narrative

Every week, the same question appears in your WhatsApp group. Someone needs an electrician. A boiler's broken. The roof's leaking. And every week, the same chaos ensues—dozens of messages, half-remembered names, someone's cousin's mate who might do it cheap.

Meanwhile, that brilliant plumber Sarah used last month? Lost in the chat history, never to be found again.

**Neighbour Approved remembers what your community forgets.** We live right in your WhatsApp group, quietly keeping track of who your neighbours actually trust. When someone recommends a provider, that's captured as an endorsement. When you need someone, you'll see a summary of all endorsed providers. React with an emoji, get their contacts privately. It's that simple.

### The Promise

- No more repeated questions about the same services
- See exactly how many neighbours endorse each provider
- Get contact details privately with a single emoji reaction
- Watch your community's wisdom accumulate over time
- New neighbours instantly inherit years of collective knowledge

### The Clincher

"We don't let contractors buy their way onto your list—they can only appear when your neighbours mention them. They earn endorsements through recommendations and great work. Because in your neighbourhood, trust isn't for sale—it's earned one mention at a time."

## Pitch Angle 2: "The Local Legend Programme"

### _For service providers and contractors_

### The Hook

"You can't join our platform. You have to be invited by the communities you serve. Once you're in, every mention becomes permanent value."

### The Narrative

You've built your business on word-of-mouth. Every satisfied customer tells their neighbours. But those golden moments—when someone recommends you in their WhatsApp group—vanish into the digital ether within hours.

What if every recommendation was captured? What if each mention automatically became an endorsement? What if your reputation accumulated like a pension, growing stronger with every job well done?

**Neighbour Approved turns mentions into metrics, recommendations into revenue.** You can't sign up. You can't pay to join. You enter our system only when someone in a WhatsApp group recommends you. The second person to recommend you? That's your first automatic endorsement. Every subsequent mention builds your reputation score.

### The Promise

- Enter the platform when communities mention you (you can't force your way in)
- Every additional mention becomes an automatic endorsement
- Your endorsement count appears in regular group summaries
- Community members react with emojis to get your contact details
- Build an unassailable position as endorsements accumulate
- Eventually unlock keyword bidding (but only after proving yourself)

### The Progression Path

1. **Summoned**: Someone mentions you—you exist
2. **Endorsed**: Second mention triggers automatic endorsement
3. **Established**: Multiple endorsements make you the obvious choice
4. **Legend**: Unlock keyword bidding, become synonymous with quality

### The Clincher

"Your competitors can outspend you on Google Ads. They can buy fake reviews. But they can't fake being mentioned by Mrs. Patel when her neighbour needs an electrician. On Neighbour Approved, you don't build a profile—your community builds it for you."

## Pitch Angle 3: "The Community Commerce Platform"

### _For investors and potential partners_

### The Hook

"We're building the anti-Yelp: a review platform where providers can't even join, money can't buy placement, and every recommendation automatically becomes an endorsement."

### The Narrative

Every major review platform faces the same existential crisis: the moment they monetise through advertising, users stop trusting the results. Google shows whoever pays most. Yelp's recommendation algorithm is a black box of controversy. Trust scores are for sale on every major platform.

**Neighbour Approved breaks this toxic cycle through Community-Controlled Commerce.** Providers can't sign up—they're summoned into existence when communities mention them. Every subsequent mention automatically becomes an endorsement. The platform posts regular summaries to groups showing endorsement counts. Members react with emojis to get contact details privately.

Only after earning significant community endorsements can providers unlock commercial features like keyword bidding. Even then, they're not buying placement—they're buying the right to compete, with their endorsement count always visible.

### The Viral Mechanics

- **Mention** → Provider exists
- **Second mention** → Automatic endorsement
- **Group summary** → Visible social proof
- **Emoji reactions** → Private contact sharing
- **More jobs** → More endorsements
- **Higher visibility** → More mentions
- **Network effects** → Exponential growth

### The Market Dynamics

- **TAM**: Every WhatsApp neighbourhood group globally (500M+ users in groups)
- **Revenue Model**: Keywords purchased only by highly-endorsed providers
- **Moat**: Can't be replicated—providers literally cannot join without community invitation
- **Network Effects**: Every endorsement strengthens platform value
- **Viral Loop**: Built-in through group summaries and emoji reactions

### The Unit Economics

- **CAC**: Near-zero (organic WhatsApp group adoption)
- **Virality**: Groups see value immediately through summaries
- **LTV**: High (contractors need consistent local pipeline)
- **Margins**: Software-level with minimal operational overhead
- **Defensibility**: Impossible to copy—requires authentic community trust

### The Clincher

"We're not disrupting the $500B home services market. We're simply making visible the trust networks that already control it. And once communities see their collective wisdom organised and accessible, they never go back."

## Pitch Angle 4: "The WhatsApp Commerce Layer"

### _For technical partners and integration discussions_

### The Hook

"2 billion people use WhatsApp. They're already recommending services. We just make it systematic."

### The Narrative

WhatsApp groups are the world's largest untapped commercial network. Every day, millions of purchasing decisions are influenced by neighbourhood groups, parent committees, hobby clubs. But this massive trust-based commerce layer has no memory, no organisation, no way to capture value.

**Neighbour Approved is the commercial memory layer for WhatsApp communities.** Using GREEN-API, we seamlessly integrate into existing group dynamics without disruption.

### The Technical Vision

- Invisible integration that preserves natural chat flow
- Intelligence layer that recognises service requests and recommendations
- Progressive API that unlocks features based on community validation
- White-label potential for WhatsApp Business API partners

### The Clincher

"We're not building another marketplace. We're adding commerce intelligence to the world's most trusted communication platform."

## Pitch Angle 5: "The Reputation Savings Account"

### _For quality-focused service providers_

### The Hook

"Every job you've done well is currency. It's time to start collecting interest."

### The Narrative

You've spent years building your reputation. Every satisfied customer, every job well done, every word-of-mouth recommendation—it all disappears into the void. Tomorrow, you start from zero again, competing against anyone with a van and a Facebook ad budget.

What if your reputation accumulated compound interest?

**Neighbour Approved is your reputation savings account.** Every endorsement is a deposit. Every satisfied customer adds to your balance. And when you've built enough trust capital, you can invest it in growth—bidding on keywords, featuring your specialities, expanding to neighbouring communities.

### The Value Proposition

- Your past work pays dividends forever
- Endorsements from one community transfer credibility to adjacent areas
- Build an unassailable position in your local market
- Transform reputation from intangible asset to investable capital

### The Clincher

"Bad contractors rent their reputation through paid ads. Great contractors build equity through endorsed work. Which investment strategy sounds more sustainable?"

## Universal Messaging Pillars

Across all angles, these core messages resonate:

1. **Trust Can't Be Bought**: Our progressive system ensures quality precedes commerce
2. **Community Controlled**: Neighbourhoods decide who succeeds, not algorithms
3. **Where You Already Are**: No new app, no behaviour change, just WhatsApp enhancement
4. **Compound Trust**: Every endorsement builds lasting value
5. **Local Legends Rise**: The best providers naturally dominate their communities

## Deployment Strategy

- **A/B test** pitch angles across different community types
- **Lead with trust** for consumers, revenue for contractors, scale for investors
- **Create urgency** through exclusive community onboarding windows
- **Build FOMO** by showcasing "Local Legend" success stories
- **Emphasise differentiation** from traditional review platforms constantly
