# Neighbour Approved: The Gratitude Engine

**_Building a gratitude engine for local services, where good work gets recognised and remembered, and where silence speaks louder than criticism._**

## The Revolution: Providers Can't Joinâ€”They Must Be Summoned

Traditional platforms beg for your reviews. Contractors pay to appear. Algorithms decide who you see.

**Neighbour Approved works differently. Radically differently.**

Service providers cannot sign up. They cannot pay to join. They cannot insert themselves into your community. Instead, they enter our system only when your neighbours are already talking about them.

**We don't bring providers to communities. We capture the providers communities already trust.**

## How The Complete Gratitude Engine Works

### The Natural Flow

**Day 1, 10:00 AM: The Question**
Sarah posts in the WhatsApp group: "Can anyone recommend a good electrician? My kitchen lights keep tripping."

**Day 1, 10:15 AM: The Recommendations Roll In**

- Tom says: "Used Davies Electrical last month - sorted my rewiring, proper job"
- Emma adds: "Try PowerSure - bit pricey but reliable"
- James chimes in: "Davies did mine too, definitely recommend"
- Louise adds: "Another vote for Davies, they're brilliant"

#### **What Just Happened (Invisible to the Group)**

- Davies Electrical: Summoned into existence with Tom's first mention
- Davies Electrical: First endorsement from Emma's mention (automatic)
- Davies Electrical: Second endorsement from Louise's mention (automatic)
- PowerSure: Summoned into existence (no endorsements yet, as it's their first mention)

**Day 2: The Community Feedback Loop**
Neighbour Approved posts to the group:

> "ðŸ“‹ Your Endorsed Electricians:
> â€¢ Davies Electrical (3 neighbour endorsements)
> â€¢ PowerSure (recently mentioned, no endorsements yet)
>
> React with âš¡ to receive contact details privately"

Six people react with the lightning emoji and receive private messages with contact cards.

**Day 8: The Gentle Check-In**
Sarah receives a private message: "Hi Sarah, last week you were looking for an electrician. Did you manage to get your kitchen lights sorted? If you used one of the recommended services and were happy with the work, would you like to add your endorsement for your community?"

**Sarah's Choice**
She used Davies and they were brilliant. She endorses them. Davies Electrical now has 4 endorsements.

**Next Week: The Virtuous Cycle**
When Michael asks for an electrician, the platform can immediately share that Davies Electrical has 4 community endorsements. The feedback loop strengthens.

## The Five Pillars of the Complete System

### 1. Community-Initiated Discovery

#### **Every provider is spoken into existence**

Providers can't join, advertise, or insert themselves. They appear only when your neighbours mention them. First mention creates existence. Additional mentions create endorsements. It's that simple.

### 2. Automatic Trust Capture

#### **Every recommendation is an endorsement**

When Tom recommends his plumber to Sarah, that's not just adviceâ€”it's an endorsement. The second person to mention the same provider has, by definition, validated them. We capture this trust signal automatically, in real-time.

### 3. Visible Community Wisdom

#### **The group sees its collective intelligence**

Regular summaries posted to the group show:

- Who's endorsed
- How many endorsements they have
- Who's newly mentioned

This isn't spamâ€”it's the community's own recommendations, organised and remembered. React with an emoji to get details privately.

### 4. Private Interaction, Public Benefit

#### **Personal privacy, community value**

- Endorsement requests happen privately
- Contact details shared privately
- But endorsement counts are visible to all

The community benefits from collective wisdom without anyone's privacy being compromised.

### 5. Compound Trust Building

#### **Every endorsement strengthens the network**

Each endorsement makes the next recommendation more powerful. When Davies Electrical goes from 3 to 10 to 25 endorsements, they become a community institution. New members inherit this wisdom immediately.

## Why This Changes Everything

### The Network Effect

Every element reinforces the others:

- **More mentions** â†’ More endorsements
- **More endorsements** â†’ More visibility in summaries

### The Viral Loop

1. **Visible value**: Groups see their endorsed providers regularly
2. **Social proof**: "If Davies has 15 endorsements, they must be good"
3. **FOMO**: "I should react to get these contact details"
4. **Participation**: "I should endorse my great plumber too"
5. **Growth**: Adjacent WhatsApp groups want the same system

## Privacy & Control Throughout

- **Groups control** who gets summoned (by mentioning them)
- **Individuals control** whether to endorse (private choice)
- **Everyone controls** whether to receive contact details (emoji reaction)
- **Anyone can** opt out of all messages instantly
- **Providers cannot** insert themselves or pay for placement

## The Beautiful Simplicity

Ask for help â†’ Receive recommendations â†’ See organised summaries â†’ React for contacts â†’ Use service â†’ Endorse if happy â†’ Community benefits forever

No apps to download. No websites to visit. No accounts to create. Just WhatsApp groups becoming smarter, memories becoming permanent, and good work getting recognised.

**Because good work deserves good words. Good words deserve to be remembered. And remembered words deserve to be shared.**

## The Magic Moment

Picture this: A new family moves into the neighbourhood. They join the WhatsApp group. Within minutes, they can see:

- Davies Electrical (23 endorsements)
- Sarah's Gardens (18 endorsements)

Years of community wisdom, instantly accessible. React with an emoji, receive contact cards. The neighbourhood's collective experience becomes their immediate advantage.

**That's the Gratitude Engine. Where trust travels at the speed of WhatsApp, accumulates like interest, and lasts forever.**
