# End-to-End Pipeline Test

This commit triggers a full end-to-end deployment pipeline test to verify:
- CI workflow (tests, linting, type checking)
- Container Security Scan (vulnerability scanning, SARIF artifacts)
- Deploy to Production (Docker build, SBOM generation, deployment)

All workflows should complete successfully without failures.
